## Trusted Admin

### What is this?

This is what you are called if you are a moderator of a server that uses **Connections**. This permission is for you to be able to **completely** manage a server, from changing the server prefix to joining/removing a connection.

If you are the server owner and want to add Trusted Admins, go to your server's [dashboard](https://connections.squarewebp.app/dashboard). Only give this permission to admins you trust.

### Can't access the dashboard

To access the dashboard of your server or a server that you are a moderator of, you need to be a `Trusted Admin` or the owner of the server (yes, the same one with the crown on its side).

### Connections are not punishing

**Connections** comes with connection-related moderation commands, such as `/bans user add` and `/timeout add`, used to help moderate your connection. But why isn't he punishing users?

- The user cannot be a [Trusted Admin](#trusted-admin) to be punished, nor can the server owner.

If you are the moderator of a server and want to access the dashboard, ask the server owner to add you as a `Trusted Admin` on the [dashboard](https://connections.squareweb.app/dashboard).

## Can't send messages with a bot

**Connections** currently does not support bot messages or webhooks (will be implemented in the future) in connections.

## Connections

### How do I join in private connections?

For you to join any private connection, you need the connection's unique invite link. To get the link, ask the creator of the connection.

### My private connection invite was leaked!

Don't worry, you can reset your private connection's unique invitation on your connection's **dashboard**.
