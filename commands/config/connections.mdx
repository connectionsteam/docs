## Creating a connection

`/connections create !:name :channel :max_connections`

A connection is literally where everything starts or where everything originates,
so nothing better than creating your own connection with your own customization, right?

The name of your connection must be **unique** and in the maximum 25 chars, connections can **not** have the same name, the name is like an unique ID.

Wow, do does this mean I can go around looking for any connection with some random name?
Yeah, of course, but connections can be private, so you will need the invite to join in these connections.

### Options

    <Card title="Name">

        Read more about connection names in [creating a connection](#creaing-a-connection)
    </Card>
    <Card title="Channel">
        Optional if you want to automatically connect in the connection after creating the connection.
    </Card>
    <Card title="Max Connections">
        This is how Connections helps you prevent multiple unknown users from connecting to your connection and creating confusion.

        Using this option, you tell Connections how many users/servers can connect to this connection,
        so if you pass the value `10`, only `10` servers will be able to connect to this connection
