## Trusted Admin

### What is this?

This is what you are called if you are a moderator of a server that uses **Connections**. This permission is for you to be able to **completely** manage a server, from changing the server prefix to joining/removing a connection.

If you are the server owner and want to add Trusted Admins, go to your server's [dashboard](https://connections.squarewebp.app/dashboard). Only give this permission to admins you trust.

## Premium

Everything about premium you will discover here. But why premium in a bot that is used to talk with other users? Simple!
You will further engage your server with unique features, threaded conversations, lobbies, more connections and much more that premium has/will have to offer.

### How can i buy premium?

Currently we don't have our own payment system, so you will have to purchase the premium in a different way, through a bot!

Enter in our [discord server](https://discord.gg/DSCvhYWatd), go to the [premium](https://discord.com/channels/1244349322204549181/1259563294713446400) channel and buy the premium or the VIP.

### Perks

I am too lazy to put ALL perks here, so you can go to the website in the [premium page](https://connections.squarewebp.app/premium) and discover the perks there.

### Activating

For the security of premiums, each premium has a very large unique code (yeah, VERY large),
so when you buy a premium through the bot that is on our [discord server](https://discord.gg/DSCvhYWatd),
you will receive a unique premium code and will need to activate it on your server's [dashboard](https://connections.squarewep.app/dashboard).

Note, you can activate a premium even if you already have premium on your server, so you will have even more days of premium.

### My premium ended!

Oh, we really want to help you with this, and that's why we made a backup system especially for you and your server.
When your premium runs out, Connections will automatically send you a notification saying that your server's premium has run out,
and then make a backup of all the data that was removed with the premium benefits.

Backups only last three days, so be careful when your server premium runs out.

<Tip>
  Load your premium with [/backup load](/commands/moderation/backup.mdx) command
</Tip>

### Can't access the dashboard

To access the dashboard of your server or a server that you are a moderator of, you need to be a `Trusted Admin` or the owner of the server (yes, the same one with the crown on its side).

### Connections are not punishing

**Connections** comes with connection-related moderation commands, such as `/bans user add` and `/timeout add`, used to help moderate your connection. But why isn't he punishing users?

- The user cannot be a [Trusted Admin](#trusted-admin) to be punished, nor can the server owner.

If you are the moderator of a server and want to access the dashboard, ask the server owner to add you as a `Trusted Admin` on the [dashboard](https://connections.squareweb.app/dashboard).

## Can't send messages with a bot

**Connections** currently does not support bot messages or webhooks (will be implemented in the future) in connections.

## Connections

### How do I join in private connections?

For you to join any private connection, you need the connection's unique invite link. To get the link, ask the creator of the connection.

### My private connection invite was leaked!

Don't worry, you can reset your private connection's unique invitation on your connection's **dashboard**.
