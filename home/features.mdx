### Threads

Threads come along with the Connections base system, which is to send messages between servers without having to leave yours. And we did it with threads; Just create a thread on one message and create another on the other server, but on the **same** message, and chat.

This is a completely simple system, but it helps you talk about a specific topic, without disturbing others.

### Frozen Messages

What? Frozen messages? Why the hell would I want to freeze a message? Well, we answered that for you. Each message sent over a connection is saved and deleted after 2 weeks, this means that you cannot edit/delete a message after two weeks of sending it.

When the message freezing system is activated on a **Premium** server, your messages are frozen, so you can delete/edit them after as long as necessary!

Sending a message on servers that have **premium** is advantageous, isn't it?

### Backups

Backups are the easiest way for you to bring back everything that was taken from you.
When your server's **Premium** runs out, you are notified that your server's Premium has run out and that a backup with all connections, threads and mods has been automatically created for your server.
See how to load your backup on the [backup command page](/commands/moderation/backup.mdx).

### Moderation

**Connections** comes with a vast system of settings/permissions that help with every detail in moderating your server. Activate the ones you prefer on the [dashboard](https://connections.squareweb.app/dashboard) on your server.
