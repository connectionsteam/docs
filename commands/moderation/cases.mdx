  <Card title="Case ID">
    Case ID is the **unique** ID of the case that you want to edit or view. It's
    generated randonly based on the timestamp that the case was created.

    Assuming we want to edit the case with the ID `191605d14d7`, then we would use `/cases edit 191605d14d7 REASON`.

    To view all cases of your server, you will need to go the the [dashboard](https://connections.squareweb.app/dashboard/guild/your_guild_id) of your server
